Creating a machine learning model involves several key steps. Initially, data collection is essential to gather relevant information. The process begins with problem definition to identify the issue to be solved. Next, data is collected and evaluated to understand what defines success. Following this, feature engineering determines which aspects of the data should be modeled. Modeling involves selecting the appropriate algorithm to build the model. Experiments are conducted to test and refine the model. Finally, deployment integrates the model into a practical application, completing the iterative process of data modeling.
