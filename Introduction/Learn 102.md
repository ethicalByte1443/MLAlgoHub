# **Understand ML in 6 Steps**

---

### **1. Problem Definition**

- **Supervised Learning**: Training the model using labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Training the model without labeled data.
- **Transfer Learning**: Using Similar Model trained earlier to train different model.
- **Reinforcement L**: Learning by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing undesired ones.

### **2. Data**

- **Structured Data**: Organized data stored in a tabular format (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).
- **Unstructured Data**: Unorganized data that doesn't fit into traditional models (e.g., images, text, videos).


---

### **3. Evaluation**

- **Accuracy**: How often the model makes correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive results in all positive predictions.

---

### **4. Features**

- **Feature Engineering**: The process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data.
- **Feature Selection**: Choosing the most important features for training the model.



---

### **5. Modeling**

- **Model Selection**: Choosing the right model based on the problem and data.
- **Training**: Teaching the model to learn patterns from the data.
- **Testing**: Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.



---

### **6. Experimentation**

- **Improvement**: Testing different models, features, and hyperparameters to enhance performance.
- **Iteration**: Continuously refining and optimizing the model.
